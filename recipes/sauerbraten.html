    <h2> Description </h2>

    <p>
      Sauerbraten is a German roast of marinated meat, traditionally beef. Since it's generally made with tougher cuts (usually the rump roast), the meat is marinated for days at a time. The roast is sliced and served with a gravy. In some recipes, the gravy is made with gingersnaps. 
    </p>

    <h2> Ingredients </h2>

    <ul>
      <li><b>Beef</b>: Start with a 3-pound beef rump roast. </li>
      <li><b>Onions</b>: Two chopped onions lend bold flavor.</li> 
      <li><b>Red wine vinegar</b>: Red wine vinegar adds tang and helps tenderize the meat. </li>
      <li><b>Water</b>: You'll need a cup of water for the marinade.</li> 
      <li><b>Seasonings</b>: Season the marinade with salt, black pepper, whole cloves, and bay leaves.</li> 
      <li><b>Flour</b>: All-purpose flour ensures perfectly browned meat. </li>
      <li><b>Sugar</b>: A tablespoon of white sugar lends subtle sweetness.</li> 
      <li><b>Oil</b>: Vegetable oil adds moisture and creates a tender cut of meat. </li>
      <li><b>Gingersnaps</b>: Crumbled gingersnap cookies are essential for the sweet-savory gravy</li>
    </ul>
